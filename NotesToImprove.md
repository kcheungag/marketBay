Improvements Direction:
- File Structure and Naming Convention
  . fragments = subviews
- Input Screens
    . Simplify
    . eBay has AI incorporated in Description Writing
    . carousell & eBay has auto recommendation on User Input based on the Product Name they entered at first place
    . Stricter validations with back-end implementation
- UI Elements: Complex Elegants
    . Better look of Categories Bubble
    . Diverse Images of Listings, image gallery
- Listing Structure
    . Usage Conditions as a Marker
    . Titles for Seller Sections (add Buyer comments and star rating)
    . Move Message Button off the row, to isolate from Favorites
    . status = (available, on-hold, sold, removed)
- Function
    . In-app chats
    . Push-ups for updates and chats
    . Image Upload, Sequence and Edits (Cropping, Annotations)

Logic of Order Completion:
Seller Post Listing -> listing available -> Buyer Offer to Seller via Chat -> Seller accept offer -> listing on-hold -> Buyer confirm receipt of order -> listing sold -> Seller and Buyer comments and rating on each other

Things To Keep Up:
- OOPS
- validations
-
